## ``How to install and run the application?``

1. **`npm install`** once you are in the right directory, install the dependencies
2. **`npm start`** start the application by using local a server (this is in development mode)

This might take a while to load up   <br />

___
## ``What did I learn?``

- User authentication (sign up/sign in/sign out)
- Creating and maintaining an online database using Firebase services. 
- Creating functions that will be run from an online server
- How to host and deploy using Firebase
- A better understanding of backend
- Security rules

___
## ``Technologies Used``

- ReactJs
- Javascript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Firebase
- Redux
- Material-UI
- Thunk
- Firestore
- Moment.js

___
## ``Difficulties I encountered, along with the solutions``

- **Difficulty:** Configurations of Redux to work with Firebase and Firestore  <br />
**Solution:** Turns out I was using the outdated configuration of them

- **Difficulty:** Firebase profile is not updating <br />
**Solution:** Took me several days to figure this out, fixed it by using an updated version of Firebase and changing the configuration

- **Difficulty:** Sometimes the Firebase and Firestore data would not synchronize  <br />
 **Solution:** I figure out that there is a connectivity issue and there is a certain limit of actions allowed per hour
